Organ donation and shifting populations
Organ Donation

I looked at the data on Organ Transplant Centers (OTC) in the United States and the counties whose residents  live more than 100 miles from any OTC.

Using Census data, I show the demographics and poverty level of those counties.

I tie these to the 11 OTPN transplant regions in the United State to show which demographics and
challenges each one faces in equitable access to organ transplantation.

I did not look at Alaska, Hawaii, or Puerto Rico.
